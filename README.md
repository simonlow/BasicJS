# BasicJS

This JavaScript repository includes multiple different JavaScript files that perform basic arithmetic and logical functions, functions on datasets also found in the repository, and more complicated functions on numbers and arrays. Its purpose is to demonstrate my baseline ability to perform tasks in JavaScript that don't have to do with a website.
